## Hi there, I'm **rakaso598** 👋  

### I believe coding is about modeling a developer's values in the computer world.  

Just as I express my thoughts in words and my inspirations through images, coding is also a process of conveying a developer's values. I chose the path of a developer out of a desire to communicate these values in the digital realm. Ultimately, I aim to create meaningful changes through technology.  

I am proficient in Spring Boot and Java, and I am also familiar with web standard technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I maximize the efficiency of my coding learning and research by utilizing conversational AI technology, which enhances the speed and accuracy of problem-solving and project development.  

💻 **Currently working on:** Spring Boot Projects  
🌱 **Currently learning:** AWS EC2, RDS, Lambda
