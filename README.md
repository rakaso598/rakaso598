## Hi there, I'm **rakaso598** 👋

### I think coding is modeling the developer's values ​​into the computer world.

Just as I express my thoughts in words and my inspiration in pictures, coding is also a process of modeling the developer's values. I chose the path of a developer with the desire to convey these values ​​into the computer world. Ultimately, I am a developer who wants to create meaningful changes through technology.

I am proficient in Spring Boot and Java, and I am also familiar with web standard technologies using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am maximizing the efficiency of code learning and research by utilizing conversational AI technology, and through this, I am increasing the speed and accuracy of problem solving and project development.

💻 **Currently working on:** Spring Boot Projects  
🌱 **Currently learning:** AWS EC2, RDS, Lambda
