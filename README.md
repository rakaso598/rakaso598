## Hi there, I'm **rakaso598** 👋

I believe that coding is the process of modeling a developer's values in the world of computers. Just as thoughts are expressed through writing and inspiration is conveyed through art, coding is also a way to model a developer's values. It was this desire to communicate these values in the digital realm that led me to choose the path of a developer. Ultimately, I am a developer who aims to create meaningful change through technology.
