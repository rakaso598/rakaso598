# Hi there, I'm rakaso598 👋

I believe coding is about **bringing a developer's values to life in the digital world**.  
Just as words express thoughts and images convey inspiration, coding is a way to communicate and model ideas. I chose this path to share my values through technology, striving to create **meaningful change** in the digital realm.

I’m proficient in **Spring Boot** and **Java**, with experience in web technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
By leveraging **conversational AI tools**, I enhance the efficiency of my learning and problem-solving processes, improving the speed and accuracy of my development work.

💻 **Currently working on:** Spring Boot Projects  
🌱 **Currently learning:** AWS EC2, RDS, Lambda
